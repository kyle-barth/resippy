title: GDK Herb Sauce
summary: GDK's Herb Sauce inspired by traditional Berlin recipe.
description: Berlin kebab herb sauce, also known as "Kräutersoße" in German, is a popular sauce used in German-style döner kebabs. The sauce is typically made from a blend of yogurt, mayonnaise, and various herbs such as parsley, dill, and mint. Its origins are rooted in the German-Turkish street food scene and were popularized in the 1970s and 1980s by Turkish immigrants in Berlin. The sauce's tangy and herby flavor complements the spiced meat in the döner kebab and has since become a staple condiment for many other dishes such as grilled meats, salads, and sandwiches. Today, Berlin kebab herb sauce is enjoyed not only in Germany but also in many other parts of Europe and around the world.
