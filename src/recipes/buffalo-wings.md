title: Air Fryer Buffalo Wings
summary: Spicy crispy chicken wings flavoured with the famous sauce.
description: Buffalo wings were invented in the 1960s in Buffalo, New York by a woman named Teressa Bellissimo. The story goes that one evening, when her son and his friends came to her restaurant, she had to improvise a quick snack with the only ingredients available; chicken wings, hot sauce, and butter. She deep-fried the wings, then tossed them in the hot sauce and butter mixture, creating the first batch of Buffalo wings. They were an instant hit and quickly became a local specialty. Today, Buffalo wings can be found all over the world, with many variations of the sauce and accompaniments.
